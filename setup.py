    long_description="""pyHarmonySearch is a pure Python implementation of the harmony search (HS) global optimization algorithm. HS is a metaheuristic search algorithm that, similar to simulated annealing, tabu, and evolutionary searches, is based on real world phenomena. Specifically, HS mimics a jazz band improvising together. Courtesy `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_search>`_:

    In the HS algorithm, each musician (= decision variable) plays (= generates) a note (= a value) for finding a best harmony (= global optimum) all together.

pyHarmonySearch supports both continuous and discrete variables and can take advantage of parallel processing using `Python's built-in multiprocessing module <http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html>`_.
